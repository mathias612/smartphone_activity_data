Overview:

This Github repository hosts the R code related to the project for the Johns Hopkins Data Specialization “Getting and Cleaning Data” course.  This project covers best practices for how data scientists clean data in preparation for further analysis to be conducted.



Data: 

The data used in this project is from University of California Irvine (UCI) and is the “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set”. More information about the data including getting the original data itself can be located at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#.



Work performed:

The data set above has been stored in the UCI HAR Dataset/ directory. The CodeBook.md file describes the data including the work completed to clean it. The run_analysis.R file is the script used to generate the tidy.csv file that stores the data for future analysis. The tidy.csv file includes the mean and standard deviation for each activity and is broken down by the activity performed and the subject’s number.
